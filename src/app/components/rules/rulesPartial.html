                    <li>First prize: $[TBD]</li>
                    <li>Second prize: $[TBD]</li>
                    <li>Third prize: $[TBD]</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>If multiple players are contending for any of the above places, the following rules will apply:
                <ul>
                    <li>The players tied in a particular position will share that spot.&nbsp;</li>
                    <li>The position of the player with the next highest point will be pushed down by the number of players sharing that spot.</li>
                    <li>Let's consider two examples with A, B, C, D and E playing.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4 style="padding-left: 60px;">Example 1</h4>
        <p style="padding-left: 60px;">A - 100 <br />B - 100 <br />C - 80 <br />D - 80 <br />E - 60</p>
        <p style="padding-left: 60px;">A and B are joint firsts. There will be no second place. C and D are joint thirds.<br />A and B will be entitled to the sum of first and second place prize money.<br />C and D will be entitled to the third place prize money.</p>
        <h4 style="padding-left: 60px;">Example 2</h4>
        <p style="padding-left: 60px;">A - 100 <br />B - 100 <br />C - 100 <br />D - 80 <br />E - 60</p>
        <p style="padding-left: 60px;">A, B and C are joint firsts. There will be no second or third places.<br />A, B and C will be entitled to the sum of first, second and third place prize money.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>In both the examples, how the winners decide to share the loot, is up to them. They can divide them equally or use any other method to solve this problem.</li>
            <!--<li>If multiple players are contending for any of the above places, the following rules will apply:
                <ul>-->
                    <!--<li>If multiple players are tied in the 1st position, a coin toss between the players will decide the winner and subsequent position of the other players.</li>-->
                    <!--<li>All remaining positions will be decided with a coin toss in a similar manner, after prioritizing players that were pushed out from previous higher level wins</li>-->
                    <!--<li>As an example, if A, B, C, D and E are playing, and in the final scores A and B are tied for 1st position, C and D are tied in 2nd position, and E is in 3rd position, the final prize distribution will be decided as follows:-->
                        <!--<ul>-->
                            <!--<li>A and B will split the total amount of </li>-->
                            <!--<li>Toss between C and D &gt;D wins  &gt; D gets 3rd prize</li>-->
                        <!--</ul>-->
                    <!--</li>-->
                <!--</ul>-->
